each time someone tries to reserve a seat, start a ballot, if no other 
ballots are going on for said seat then seat shoyld be reserved

coukd do something where the upper application stores each seat,
when a user tries to reserve said seat it starts an election, each user 
represents their own paxos node, start an ellection with you as leader,
if you win the ballot, seat is reserved, else, no one gets it

over idea is create a protocol for each seat

multiple instances of seat.ex for fault tolerance
  the state is a mapping between seat and reservtion
  if we have a paxos for each seat, we can use propose to set the value for each seat
  one person starts a vote, then the paxos in that seat becomes a leader
  

muitple instances of seat x, and a paxos layer for each, user tries to reserver
propose a value for each corresponding paxos, then procede the ballot
